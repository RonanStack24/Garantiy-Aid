# Garantiy-Aid backend

This is the real-data API for the beneficiary mobile app. It implements account access, the signed-in beneficiary profile, program enrollments, the next assigned distribution schedule, and scoped QR claim-pass issuance. Data is stored in PostgreSQL through Prisma.

## Run locally

1. Install the packages and start Prisma's local PostgreSQL server:

```powershell
npm install
npm run db:local
```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Put the PostgreSQL URL printed by `db:local` in `DATABASE_URL` and replace `AUTH_PEPPER` with a long random value.
3. Apply the included migration, seed the starter service area, and start the API:

```powershell
npm run db:deploy
npm run db:seed
npm run dev
```

The API listens at `http://localhost:3000`. `GET /health` confirms that PostgreSQL is connected. The seed creates the verified mobile test account `0917 555 0147` with an approved 4Ps enrollment and an upcoming schedule.

During development, OTP codes are printed in the backend terminal and returned as `developmentOtp` in the response. Production never returns or logs the code; an SMS provider must be connected before production use.

## Implemented endpoints

- `GET /health`
- `GET /barangays`
- `POST /auth/register`
- `POST /auth/otp/request`
- `POST /auth/otp/verify`
- `POST /auth/logout`
- `GET /beneficiaries/me`
- `GET /beneficiaries/me/overview`
- `POST /beneficiaries/me/claim-pass`

Protected endpoints use `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`. Access tokens are random, stored only as hashes, expire after seven days, and are revoked by logout.

Claim passes are opaque, distribution-scoped values returned only when issued. PostgreSQL stores a keyed hash rather than the raw QR value. Issuing a replacement revokes the previous active pass, and each pass expires at the end of its assigned schedule. Staff-side scanning and claim approval remain separate work.
